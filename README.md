# HodgePodge

A collection of UI animations in practical real-life examples. 

Whenever I saw a cool site,  I can't help inspecting it and think about how I'd solve it with purely CSS. This is a repository of trying to re-create many interesting animations with purely CSS - (or very minimum javascript. i.e., for swapping classes only).

## Stripe Dropdown
A recreation of the dropdown animation on [Stripe's](https://stripe.com/) homepage with just CSS.
